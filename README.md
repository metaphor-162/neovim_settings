# Public Vim Dotfiles

A lightweight, secure, and purely Vim-focused configuration repository designed for deployment on remote servers.

## Objective
This project provides a clean Vim/Neovim setup by:
- Removing AI integrations (e.g., Copilot) and sensitive credentials.
- Providing an automated, zero-interaction shell script for deployment.
- Keeping configurations modular and easy to maintain.

## Setup
(Detailed setup instructions will be added as the installation script is developed.)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `sh install.sh`.
